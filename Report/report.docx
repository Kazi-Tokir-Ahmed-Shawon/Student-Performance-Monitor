BACKGROUND OF THE PROJECT:
The academic process of higher education must achieve something that improves the learning process. To make this happen, universities must monitor and evaluate the results of the teaching process by looking at student performance. We are going to design, create and deliver software that will help universities promote a more productive and effective way to assess students everywhere and that is the goal of our project. Performance monitoring includes assessments that play an important role in providing students, teachers, administrators, and policymakers with the information they need to make decisions. If we talk about the main part of our project, here is the concept of Course Outcome (CO) and Program Learning Outcomes (PLO), each CO is mapped to a PLO, and through each PLO students are expected to learn from the course 'problem analysis, design, Skill implementation, etc. 'will be known. The system allows input from IEB to determine PLO requirements. The project will evaluate to see if the COS mapped PLOs are met for each student to assess student proficiency. Faculties then input COs for each of their students so that the system can map the COs to the PLO accordingly. PLOs are carefully and specially selected to ensure that students achieve the most in a course so that students can monitor their progress in each sector and pinpoint the areas where self-improvement and self-development are needed. We are hopeful that our software will help institutional students’ progress, departmental performance and assist in the distribution and allocation of their improved resources.

OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT:
Student progress monitoring is a practice that helps teachers continually evaluate the effectiveness of their learning and use student performance data to make more significant instructional decisions. If the rate at which a particular student is learning seems inadequate, the teacher can adjust the instruction. Our project seeks to create user-friendly software that will serve as a platform for many to improve the quality of education of students, faculty, and other members of the university and in advanced technology in the field of education. We believe that the information we have collected, evaluated, and equipped will lead to opportunities for greater advances in our education and will also make a significant contribution to computer science.
SCOPE OF THE PROJECT:
This CHAPTER will discuss falls within the scope of the system. To recognize the importance or quality of the scope, we are to contemplate what the system will accomplish i.e.  The purpose of the system and the desired requirements that are to be met.
The main purpose of implementing such a system is to improve and digitalize the old inefficient way. In the exciting system, there exists several human roles (e.g. faculty, students) that are to get the work done manually, not by computers. Therefore, the existing system takes more time to achieve the goals while compared to the newly proposed system. The new system accomplishes this by reducing the human roles of the system and making a computer which helps us to run the system and do the work of organizing, storing and instantly querying the essential data. 
 
•	Storing useful data
•	 Securing the data by restricting access to the system.
•	 Instantly insert/ update/ delete data from the database 
•	 Generate dynamic charts from the data using defined or dynamic parameters.
•	 Reporting
•	 Project management
