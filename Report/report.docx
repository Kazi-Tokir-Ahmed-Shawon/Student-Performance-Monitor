BACKGROUND OF THE PROJECT:
The academic process of higher education must achieve something that improves the learning process. To make this happen, universities must monitor and evaluate the results of 
the teaching process by looking at student performance. We are going to design, create and deliver software that will help universities promote a more productive and effective 
way to assess students everywhere and that is the goal of our project.Performance monitoring includes assessments that play an important role in providing students, teachers, 
administrators, and policymakers with the information they need to make decisions.If we talk about the main part of our project, here is the concept of Course Outcome (CO) 
and Program Learning Outcomes (PLO), each CO is mapped to a PLO, and through each PLO students are expected to learn from the course 'problem analysis, design, Skill
implementation, etc. 'will be known. The system allows input from IEB to determine PLO requirements. The project will evaluate to see if the COS mapped PLOs are met for
each student to assess student proficiency. Faculties then input COs for each of their students so that the system can map the COs to the PLO accordingly. PLOs are carefully 
and specially selected to ensure that students achieve the most in a course so that students can monitor their progress in each sector and pinpoint the areas where self-
improvement and self-development are needed. We are hopeful that our software will help institutional students’ progress, departmental performance and assist in the distribution
and allocation of their improved resources.

OBJECTIVE OF THE PROJECT:
Student progress monitoring is a practice that helps teachers continually evaluate the effectiveness of their learning and use student performance data to make more significant 
instructional decisions. If the rate at which a particular student is learning seems inadequate, the teacher can adjust the instruction. Our project seeks to create user-friendly
software that will serve as a platform for many to improve the quality of education of students, faculty, and other members of the university and in advanced technology in the 
field of education. We believe that the information we have collected, evaluated, and equipped will lead to opportunities for greater advances in our education and will also make
a significant contribution to computer science.
